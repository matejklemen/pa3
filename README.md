# Programming assignment 3

## Setup

1. Create the SQLite database.
```
$ sqlite3 data/pa3.db < data/pa3db.sql
```

2. (Optional) Create a virtualenv and activate it.
```
$ virtualenv --python=python3 --system-site-packages wiervenv
$ source wiervenv/bin/activate
```

3. Install the project's requirements with:
```
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the setup file, to set the project up for development using:
```
$ python3 setup.py develop
```

5. If you have never installed the punkt package for `nltk`, uncomment the line
with `nltk.download('punkt')` in the `main.py` file inside the `indexer` folder.

## Folder structure

```
.
├── ...
├── data                       # Folder with all the data for processing and indexing
├── indexer                    # Web crawler
│   ├── main.py                # Main indexer functions
│   └── ...                    # etc.
├── ...                        # etc.
├── inverted-index.db          # SQLite database file, generated by the indexing part.
├── report.pdf                 # Final report PDF
└── Readme.md                  # This file

```

## Running the project

Make sure you have completed and followed the setup instructions. Then, running the problem should be very simple.

Change your directory to the indexer directory and run the command `python3 main.py`. For the first time, the command
will install the `punkt` addon for nltk (if you have uncommented the line as described in the setup instructions) and
create the index in the SQLite database. It will also run the predefined search queries and output the results.

If you run `python3 main.py` again, the index will not be created again, since a .index_exists.tmp file will be created
after the first run, however, the search queries will execute again.
To also run the naive search queries, uncomment the line
```python3
# search_naive(test_query)
```
at the bottom of the `main.py` file
and the queries will execute with the next run of the program.
